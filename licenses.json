As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.

This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.

Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. \n\nIf you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.\n\n## Disabling Colors\n\nTo disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:\n\n```bash\nnode myapp.js --no-color\n```\n\n## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)\n\n```js\nvar name = 'Marak';\nconsole.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);\n// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'\n```\n\n## Custom themes\n\n### Using standard API\n\n```js\n\nvar colors = require('colors');\n\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(\"this is an error\".error);\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(\"this is a warning\".warn);\n```\n\n### Using string safe API\n\n```js\nvar colors = require('colors/safe');\n\n// set single property\nvar error = colors.red;\nerror('this is red');\n\n// set theme\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(colors.error(\"this is an error\"));\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(colors.warn(\"this is a warning\"));\n```\n\n*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*"

Most of the files in this collection are for applications\nthat are expected to run in obsolete web browsers. For most purposes, json2.js\nis the best choice.\n\n\njson2.js: This file creates a JSON property in the global object, if there\nisn't already one, setting its value to an object containing a stringify\nmethod and a parse method. The parse method uses the eval method to do the\nparsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against\naccidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing,\nprefering the built-in JSON object.\n\njson.js: This file does everything that json2.js does. It also adds a\ntoJSONString method and a parseJSON method to Object.prototype. Use of this\nfile is not recommended.\n\njson_parse.js: This file contains an alternative JSON parse function that\nuses recursive descent instead of eval.\n\njson_parse_state.js: This files contains an alternative JSON parse function that\nuses a state machine instead of eval.\n\ncycle.js: This file contains two functions, JSON.decycle and JSON.retrocycle,\nwhich make it possible to encode cyclical structures and dags in JSON, and to\nthen recover them. JSONPath is used to represent the links.\nhttp://GOESSNER.net/articles/JsonPath/"

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4.

This is so that\nyou can go and analyse them if you want. However, you can call the following function\nto remove processed messages:\n\n```js\nqueue.clean(function(err) {\n    // All processed (ie. acked) messages have been deleted\n})\n```\n\nAnd if you haven't already, you should call this to make sure indexes have\nbeen added in MongoDB. Of course, if you've called this once (in some kind\none-off script) you don't need to call it in your program. Of course, check\nthe changelock to see if you need to update them with new releases:\n\n```js\nqueue.createIndexes(function(err, indexName) {\n    // The indexes needed have been added to MongoDB.\n})\n```\n\n## Creating a Queue ##\n\nTo create a queue, call the exported function with the `MongoClient`, the name\nand a set of opts. The MongoDB collection used is the same name as the name\npassed in:\n\n```\nvar mongoDbQueue = require('mongodb-queue')\n\n// an instance of a queue\nvar queue1 = mongoDbQueue(db, 'a-queue')\n// another queue which uses the same collection as above\nvar queue2 = mongoDbQueue(db, 'a-queue')\n```\n\nUsing `queue1` and `queue2` here won't interfere with each other and will play along nicely, but that's not\na good idea code-wise - just use the same object. This example is for illustrative purposes only.\n\nNote: Don't use the same queue name twice with different options, otherwise behaviour is undefined and again\nit's not something you should do.\n\nTo pass in options for the queue:\n\n```\nvar resizeQueue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'resize-queue', { visibility : 30, delay : 15 })\n```\n\nThis example shows a queue with a message visibility of 30s and a delay to each message of 15s.\n\n## Options ##\n\n### name ###\n\nThis is the name of the MongoDB Collection you wish to use to store the messages.\nEach queue you create will be it's own collection.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nvar resizeImageQueue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'resize-image-queue')\nvar notifyOwnerQueue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'notify-owner-queue')\n```\n\nThis will create two collections in MongoDB called `resize-image-queue` and `notify-owner-queue`.\n\n### visibility - Message Visibility Window ###\n\nDefault: `30`\n\nBy default, if you don't ack a message within the first 30s after receiving it,\nit is placed back in the queue so it can be fetched again. This is called the\nvisibility window.\n\nYou may set this visibility window on a per queue basis. For example, to set the\nvisibility to 15 seconds:\n\n```\nvar queue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'queue', { visibility : 15 })\n```\n\nAll messages in this queue now have a visibility window of 15s, instead of the\ndefault 30s.\n\n### delay - Delay Messages on Queue ###\n\nDefault: `0`\n\nWhen a message is added to a queue, it is immediately available for retrieval.\nHowever, there are times when you might like to delay messages coming off a queue.\nie. if you set delay to be `10`, then every message will only be available for\nretrieval 10s after being added.\n\nTo delay all messages by 10 seconds, try this:\n\n```\nvar queue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'queue', { delay : 10 })\n```\n\nThis is now the default for every message added to the queue.\n\n### deadQueue - Dead Message Queue ###\n\nDefault: none\n\nMessages that have been retried over `maxRetries` will be pushed to this queue so you can\nautomatically see problem messages.\n\nPass in a queue (that you created) onto which these messages will be pushed:\n\n```js\nvar deadQueue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'dead-queue')\nvar queue = mongoDbQueue(db, 'queue', { deadQueue : deadQueue })\n```\n\nIf you pop a message off the `queue` over `maxRetries` times and have still not acked it,\nit will be pushed onto the `deadQueue` for you. This happens when you `.get()` (not when\nyou miss acking a message in it's visibility window). By doing it when you call `.get()`,\nthe unprocessed message will be received, pushed to the `deadQueue`, acked off the normal\nqueue and `.get()` will check for new messages prior to returning you one (or none).\n\n### maxRetries - Maximum Retries per Message ###\n\nDefault: 5\n\nThis option only comes into effect if you pass in a `deadQueue` as shown above. What this\nmeans is that if an item is popped off the queue `maxRetries` times (e.g. 5) and not acked,\nit will be moved to this `deadQueue` the next time it is tried to pop off. You can poll your\n`deadQueue` for dead messages much like you can poll your regular queues.\n\nThe payload of the messages in the dead queue are the entire messages returned when `.get()`ing\nthem from the original queue.\n\ne.g.\n\nGiven this message:\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  id: '533b1eb64ee78a57664cc76c',\n  ack: 'c8a3cc585cbaaacf549d746d7db72f69',\n  payload: 'Hello, World!',\n  tries: 1 }\n}\n```\n\nIf it is not acked within the `maxRetries` times, then when you receive this same message\nfrom the `deadQueue`, it may look like this:\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  id: '533b1ecf3ca3a76b667671ef',\n  ack: '73872b204e3f7be84050a1ce82c5c9c0',\n  payload: {\n    id: '533b1eb64ee78a57664cc76c',\n    ack: 'c8a3cc585cbaaacf549d746d7db72f69',\n    payload: 'Hello, World!',\n    tries: 5 }\n  },\n  tries: 1\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the payload from the `deadQueue` is exactly the same as the original message\nwhen it was on the original queue (except with the number of tries set to 5).\n\n## Operations ##\n\n### .add() ###\n\nYou can add a string to the queue:\n\n```js\nqueue.add('Hello, World!', function(err, id) {\n    // Message with payload 'Hello, World!' added.\n    // 'id' is returned, useful for logging.\n})\n```\n\nOr add an object of your choosing:\n\n```js\nqueue.add({ err: 'E_BORKED', msg: 'Broken' }, function(err, id) {\n    // Message with payload { err: 'E_BORKED', msg: 'Broken' } added.\n    // 'id' is returned, useful for logging.\n})\n```\n\nOr add multiple messages:\n\n```js\nqueue.add(['msg1', 'msg2', 'msg3'], function(err, ids) {\n    // Messages with payloads 'msg1', 'msg2' & 'msg3' added.\n    // All 'id's are returned as an array, useful for logging.\n})\n```\n\nYou can delay individual messages from being visible by passing the `delay` option:\n\n```js\nqueue.add('Later', { delay: 120 }, function(err, id) {\n    // Message with payload 'Later' added.\n    // 'id' is returned, useful for logging.\n    // This message won't be available for getting for 2 mins.\n})\n```\n\n### .get() ###\n\nRetrieve a message from the queue:\n\n```js\nqueue.get(function(err, msg) {\n    // You can now process the message\n    // IMPORTANT: The callback will not wait for an message if the queue is empty.  The message will be undefined if the queue is empty.\n})\n```\n\nYou can choose the visibility of an individual retrieved message by passing the `visibility` option:\n\n```js\nqueue.get({ visibility: 10 }, function(err, msg) {\n    // You can now process the message for 10s before it goes back into the queue if not ack'd instead of the duration that is set on the queue in general\n})\n```\n\nMessage will have the following structure:\n\n```js\n{\n  id: '533b1eb64ee78a57664cc76c', // ID of the message\n  ack: 'c8a3cc585cbaaacf549d746d7db72f69', // ID for ack and ping operations\n  payload: 'Hello, World!', // Payload passed when the message was addded\n  tries: 1 // Number of times this message has been retrieved from queue without being ack'd\n}\n```\n\n### .ack() ###\n\nAfter you have received an item from a queue and processed it, you can delete it\nby calling `.ack()` with the unique `ackId` returned:\n\n```js\nqueue.get(function(err, msg) {\n    queue.ack(msg.ack, function(err, id) {\n        // this message has now been removed from the queue\n    })\n})\n```\n\n### .ping() ###\n\nAfter you have received an item from a queue and you are taking a while\nto process it, you can `.ping()` the message to tell the queue that you are\nstill alive and continuing to process the message:\n\n```js\nqueue.get(function(err, msg) {\n    queue.ping(msg.ack, function(err, id) {\n        // this message has had it's visibility window extended\n    })\n})\n```\n\nYou can also choose the visibility time that gets added by the ping operation by passing the `visibility` option:\n\n```js\nqueue.get(function(err, msg) {\n    queue.ping(msg.ack, { visibility: 10 }, function(err, id) {\n        // this message has had it's visibility window extended by 10s instead of the visibilty set on the queue in general\n    })\n})\n```\n\n### .total() ###\n\nReturns the total number of messages that has ever been in the queue, including\nall current messages:\n\n```js\nqueue.total(function(err, count) {\n    console.log('This queue has seen %d messages', count)\n})\n```\n\n### .size() ###\n\nReturns the total number of messages that are waiting in the queue.\n\n```js\nqueue.size(function(err, count) {\n    console.log('This queue has %d current messages', count)\n})\n```\n\n### .inFlight() ###\n\nReturns the total number of messages that are currently in flight. ie. that\nhave been received but not yet acked:\n\n```js\nqueue.inFlight(function(err, count) {\n    console.log('A total of %d messages are currently being processed', count)\n})\n```\n\n### .done() ###\n\nReturns the total number of messages that have been processed correctly in the\nqueue:\n\n```js\nqueue.done(function(err, count) {\n    console.log('This queue has processed %d messages', count)\n})\n```\n\n### .clean() ###\n\nDeletes all processed mesages from the queue. Of course, you can leave these hanging around\nif you wish, but delete them if you no longer need them. Perhaps do this using `setInterval`\nfor a regular cleaning:\n\n```js\nqueue.clean(function(err) {\n    console.log('The processed messages have been deleted from the queue')\n})\n```\n\n### Notes about Numbers ###\n\nIf you add up `.size() + .inFlight() + .done()` then you should get `.total()`\nbut this will only be approximate since these are different operations hitting the database\nat slightly different times. Hence, a message or two might be counted twice or not at all\ndepending on message turnover at any one time. You should not rely on these numbers for\nanything but are included as approximations at any point in time.\n\n## Use of MongoDB ##\n\nWhilst using MongoDB recently and having a need for lightweight queues, I realised\nthat the atomic operations that MongoDB provides are ideal for this kind of job.\n\nSince everything it atomic, it is impossible to lose messages in or around your\napplication. I guess MongoDB could lose them but it's a safer bet it won't compared\nto your own application.\n\nAs an example of the atomic nature being used, messages stay in the same collection\nand are never moved around or deleted, just a couple of fields are set, incremented\nor deleted. We always use MongoDB's excellent `collection.findAndModify()` so that\neach message is updated atomically inside MongoDB and we never have to fetch something,\nchange it and store it back.\n\n## Note on MongoDB Version ##\n\nWhen using MongoDB v2.6 and the v1.3.23 version of the mongodb driver from npm, I was getting\na weird error similar to \"key $exists must not start with '$'\". Yes, very strange. Anyway, the fix\nis to install a later version of the driver. I have tried this with v1.4.9 and it seems ok.\n\n## Releases ##\n\nYay! We made it to v1.0. This means that development may slow down but to be honest, I have pretty\nmuch all of the functionality I want in this thing done. Thanks to everyone for feedback, reports\nand pull requests.\n\n### 2.1.0 (2016-04-21) ###\n\n* [FIX] Fix to indexes (thanks https://github.com/ifightcrime) when lots of messages\n\n### 2.0.0 (2014-11-12) ###\n\n* [NEW] Update MongoDB API from v1 to v2 (thanks https://github.com/hanwencheng)\n\n### 1.0.1 (2015-05-25) ###\n\n* [NEW] Test changes only\n\n### 1.0.0 (2014-10-30) ###\n\n* [NEW] Ability to specify a visibility window when getting a message (thanks https://github.com/Gertt)\n\n### 0.9.1 (2014-08-28) ###\n\n* [NEW] Added .clean() method to remove old (processed) messages\n* [NEW] Add 'delay' option to queue.add() so individual messages can be delayed separately\n* [TEST] Test individual 'delay' option for each message\n\n### 0.7.0 (2014-03-24) ###\n\n* [FIX] Fix .ping() so only visible/non-deleted messages can be pinged\n* [FIX] Fix .ack() so only visible/non-deleted messages can be pinged\n* [TEST] Add test to make sure messages can't be acked twice\n* [TEST] Add test to make sure an acked message can't be pinged\n* [INTERNAL] Slight function name changes, nicer date routines\n\n### 0.6.0 (2014-03-22) ###\n\n* [NEW] The msg.id is now returned on successful Queue.ping() and Queue.ack() calls\n* [NEW] Call quueue.ensureIndexes(callback) to create them\n* [CHANGE] When a message is acked, 'deleted' is now set to the current time (not true)\n* [CHANGE] The queue is now created synchronously\n\n### 0.5.0 (2014-03-21) ###\n\n* [NEW] Now adds two indexes onto the MongoDB collection used for the message\n* [CHANGE] The queue is now created by calling the async exported function\n* [DOC] Update to show how the queues are now created\n\n### 0.4.0 (2014-03-20) ###\n\n* [NEW] Ability to ping retrieved messages a. la.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)\n* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)\n* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)\n* [`punycode.js` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/426298c8c1c0d5b5224ac3658c41e7c2a3fe9377/lib/punycode.js) (note: [not fully compliant](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2072))\n\nThis project is [bundled](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/punycode.js) with [Node.js v0.6.2+](https://github.com/joyent/node/compare/975f1930b1...61e796decc) and [io.js v1.0.0+](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/lib/punycode.js).\n\n## Installation\n\nVia [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (only required for Node.js releases older than v0.6.2):\n\n```bash\nnpm install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```bash\nbower install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Component](https://github.com/component/component):\n\n```bash\ncomponent install bestiejs/punycode.js\n```\n\nIn a browser:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"punycode.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [io.js](https://iojs.org/), [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):\n\n```js\nvar punycode = require('punycode');\n```\n\nIn [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):\n\n```js\nload('punycode.js');\n```\n\nUsing an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\n\n```js\nrequire(\n  {\n    'paths': {\n      'punycode': 'path/to/punycode'\n    }\n  },\n  ['punycode'],\n  function(punycode) {\n    console.log(punycode);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `punycode.decode(string)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string of ASCII symbols to a string of Unicode symbols.\n\n```js\n// decode domain name parts\npunycode.decode('maana-pta'); // 'mañana'\npunycode.decode('--dqo34k'); // '☃-⌘'\n```\n\n### `punycode.encode(string)`\n\nConverts a string of Unicode symbols to a Punycode string of ASCII symbols.\n\n```js\n// encode domain name parts\npunycode.encode('mañana'); // 'maana-pta'\npunycode.encode('☃-⌘'); // '--dqo34k'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toUnicode(input)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string representing a domain name or an email address to Unicode. Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.\n\n```js\n// decode domain names\npunycode.toUnicode('xn--maana-pta.com');\n// → 'mañana.com'\npunycode.toUnicode('xn----dqo34k.com');\n// → '☃-⌘.com'\n\n// decode email addresses\npunycode.toUnicode('джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq');\n// → 'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toASCII(input)`\n\nConverts a lowercased Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that’s already in ASCII.\n\n```js\n// encode domain names\npunycode.toASCII('mañana.com');\n// → 'xn--maana-pta.com'\npunycode.toASCII('☃-⌘.com');\n// → 'xn----dqo34k.com'\n\n// encode email addresses\npunycode.toASCII('джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa');\n// → 'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq'\n```\n\n### `punycode.ucs2`\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`\n\nCreates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.decode('abc');\n// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]\n// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:\npunycode.ucs2.decode('\\uD834\\uDF06');\n// → [0x1D306]\n```\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`\n\nCreates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);\n// → 'abc'\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);\n// → '\\uD834\\uDF06'\n```\n\n### `punycode.version`\n\nA string representing the current Punycode.js version number.\n\n## Unit tests & code coverage\n\nAfter cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.\n\nOnce that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.\n\nTo generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n## Author\n\n| [![twitter/mathias](https://gravatar.com/avatar/24e08a9ea84deb17ae121074d0f17125?s=70)](https://twitter.com/mathias \"Follow @mathias on Twitter\") |\n|---|\n| [Mathias Bynens](https://mathiasbynens.be/) |\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [![twitter/jdalton](https://gravatar.com/avatar/299a3d891ff1920b69c364d061007043?s=70)](https://twitter.com/jdalton \"Follow @jdalton on Twitter\") |\n|---|\n| [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) |\n\n## License\n\nPunycode.js is available under the [MIT](https://mths.be/mit) license."

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
